# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify images of digits (0-9) with high accuracy. Follow the steps below to set up the project, preprocess data, train the model, and test it with new or test data.
